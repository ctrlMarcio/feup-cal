Exercises solved during the [Algorithm Design and Analysis](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=436441) course, in the second year of FEUP's Master in Informatics and Computing Engineering.

## Requirements

* [Googletest - Google C++ testing framework](https://github.com/google/googletest). To download it, simply clone the repo from GitHub. More info on its place below.

## Compile and run

To open and work with an IDE or a text editor, take into account that each tp behaves as a standalone project, open it that way.
You can edit the CMakeLists.txt file for the testing subdirectory, but leaving it as it is, implies that Googletest framework is inside lib, which inside each of the tps.
